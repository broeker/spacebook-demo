Spacebook was inspired by my search for the simplest possible way to spin up a modern website in the least amount of time, with the freedom to extend as needed, zero cost, no maintenance burden, and virtually zero effort. 

Eleventy was a perfect fit, and I spent many hours researching these and other starter projects for ideas and inspiration: 

* [Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) by Dan Urbanowiczi -- I used this as the basis for Netlify CMS integration and for my initial overall code structure
* [Eleventy-Tailwind-AlpineJS Starter](https://github.com/gregwolanski/eleventy-tailwindcss-alpinejs-starter) by Greg Wolanski -- this was the method I followed for integrating Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js
* [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone) by Zach Leatherman and the Eleventy team -- I used this as an "official" reference even though spacebooks do not contain blog functionality
* [Staticrypt implementation](https://gist.github.com/epicfaace/c1a4452401af14d35b60fe211f2c1559) by various, mostly a ton of trial and error and this helpful Gist linked from the Staticrypt issue queue
* [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) by Shu Ding -- this is a Next.js project that also uses Tailwind and helped inspire the initial design/layout of a spacebook. (Spacebook has now diverged from this quite a bit, and in retrospect, this is a fairly common layout for many modern documentation sites and for a good reason üòç) 
* [Add Search to an Eleventy website with Elasticlunr](https://www.belter.io/eleventy-search/) by Duncan McDougall -- this gave me the basics for integrating Elasticlunr
* [404](https://github.com/Siddhant-K-code/404-Error-Page---Astronaut) -- I wanted a spacebook-themed [404 not found](/why-are-you-here) page and found this one by Siddhant-K-code. I'm still tinkering on the JS for the animation :)

Overall  I investigated and researched more than a dozen additional [Eleventy starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) for inspiration, code snippets, and to learn more about how Eleventy works. Thanks to all -- there is no one "right way" to build an Eleventy site and this is just one small attempt.
