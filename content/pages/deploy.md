Deploying changes to your site could not be any easier: 

* **If you are editing your files directly on Github**, your site is building each time you save a commit to your main branch. Depending on the amount of pages your site has it usually takes 60 seconds or less to complete a deploy. 
* **If you are editing your files locally**, your site will automatically build every time you push changes or accept a pull request into your main Github branch. Again it usually takes around 60 seconds or less unless your site is very large. 
* **If you are using Netlify CMS**, your site builds each time you click the **publish** button. 

That's it! ðŸ¤—

**Did you know?** You can monitor your deploys in realtime via your Netlify dashboard. There are also a variety of settings you can use for things like preview deploys or branch deploys.
