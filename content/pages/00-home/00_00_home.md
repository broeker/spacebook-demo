Spacebooks are easy to set up, free, and 100% open source. Create your own DIY spacebook and customize it to your needs. 

- **Writing focused** ❤️ -- beautiful typography, a minimalist design, all managed with easy-to-use Markdown
- **Speedy and accessible** 🚀 -- static files, responsive system fonts, minimal JavaScript, purge and minify All the Things, accessible to all people and devices
- **Easy to use** 😀 -- add new pages with nested navigation, tagging, automated table of contents, make edits right from your phone
- **Privacy first** 🔒 -- User-agent: \* Disallow: / is set by default with noreferrer set on all links; or, encrypt your full site with a password if desired
- **Flexible** 💪 -- horizontal or vertical navigation, disable features you don't need, add advanced features with serverless functions or Alpine.js

Your Spacebook will work across a wide variety of devices, with nested navigation, tagging, keyword search, in-page navigation, table of contents, password protection, and more.

## What is a spacebook?

Create a new spacebook for structured documentation, to sketch out new ideas, plan a new project, or whatever suits your fancy. Keep it private, or open it up to the world. Here is a look behind the scenes:

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) a fast, minimalist Node-based static site generator that stays out of your way and lets you ship only what you want to ship 🚀
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) a brilliant and tiny utility-first CSS framework 🎨
- [Elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) a lightweight full-text search engine 🔍
- [Advanced Markdown-it support](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) with footnotes, custom containers, emoji support, tables, task lists, and auto-linked images ✏️
- [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) a minimal utility-first framework for simple or advanced JavaScript 🕹️

You don't need to understand (or even touch) any of this to launch a spacebook, but it all results in a speedy, easy-to-use, and accessible website with good looks and a fine attention to detail.

**Did you know?**  Spacebooks are designed to be beautiful and functional out of the box, but you can customize as you see fit, or even use it as the basis for your creating your own Eleventy starter kit. It was built on the [shoulders of giants](/credits). 👍

## Who needs a spacebook?

A spacebook is for anybody who believes in the independent web and wants a simple, modern, and free way to put up a notebook-like thing that you own and control:

- Writers and thinkers 📓️
- Planners and dreamers 💭
- Technical doc writers 📄
- Project managers 📅
- Teachers and students 🏫

Anyone who is willing to learn a few simple things can create as many spacebooks as they'd like for any reason in the world (and, in most cases, host them for free with no ongoing costs or maintenance.)

## Basic requirements 

Anybody with a computer and some gumption should be able to get up and running with relative ease. There are just a few things you'll want to have in place before you begin. 

* The ability to run simple commands on your computer
* A (very) basic understanding of Git
* A fairly recent version of Node installed (version 12 or higher) 
* A basic understanding of Markdown
* Some general idea of how to host a static website :)

If you are feeling shaky with any of the above, there are a wide variety of beginner resources just a short search away. Some of these basic concepts (e.g. working with Markdown and hosting options) are covered elsewhere in these documents.


## Installing spacebook

A key point to remember is that this intended as a starter project; once you clone or fork the Spacebook repository, congratulations! You are now the owner of your code and are responsible for maintaining it and customizing as you wish moving forward.

:::callout
**A note about Git:** This documentation assumes you are using [Github](https://github.com), largely becuase it is the most popular provider and the one we use ourselves. In theory, any Git provider (e.g. Gitlab, Bitbucket) should work fine. However, this documentation assumes Github so if you use another provider, you'll need to adjust accordingly.

### Step one

If you already have a Github account, the best option is to simply fork the existing Spacebook repository to your own account. 

* Head to the [Spacebook repository](https://github.com/broeker/spacebook)
* Click the "**Fork**" button in the upper right!
* Customize the name of your repository as you see fit

Now you have your own remote copy of Spacebook, and it is time to install it on your machine: 

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>
```

If you just want to try this out locally without creating your own repository, you can also clone the Spacebook repository directly:

```
git clone https://github.com/broeker/spacebook
```

_Note: If you choose the second option, you'll want to remove the accompanying .git folder and add your own upstream repository if you want to use this as a basis for moving forward._ 

### Step two

Install the site and run an initial build command:

```
cd spacebook

npm install

npm run build (only necessary the first time!)
```

_If you get errors here, double check your node version and try updating to a more recent version!_

### Step three

Now spin up your local server to see your site:

```
npm run start
```

This command will start a local server, and you'll be able to work on your site with hot reloads and some nice Browsersync features. 

```
http://localhost:8080
```

At this stage, you should be set to configure your project. 💥
 
## Next steps

Now that you are up and running, you'll want to complete some basic setup:

* Basic configuration
* Toolbar configuration
* Review privacy settings
* Create your content!
