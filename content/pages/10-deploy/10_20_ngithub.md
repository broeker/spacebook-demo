Now that you've got your site in place it is time to deploy it somewhere on the web where others can interact.

The following sections outline some of the things you can do with your spacebook that take a bit more work to set up, but never fear:

* [Navigation layout](/advanced/navigation/)
* [Enabling Netlify CMS](/advanced/netlifycms/)
* [Enabling comments](/advanced/comments)
* [Enabling analytics](/advanced/analytics)
* [Password protection](/advanced/encryption/)
